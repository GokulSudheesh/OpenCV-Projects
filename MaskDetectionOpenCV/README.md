# Real time Mask Detection using OpenCV in Python
- This a very simple mask detection program made only with OpenCV. There was no training done explicitly. 
- The detection was done with the help of cascade classifiers for face, eyes, nose and mouth.
- Using these classfiers, I was able to easily detect mouth, nose, eyes etc. and determine whether the person is wearing a mask.
- However, it is not really that accurate and shows in-correct reading at times but it does the job pretty well.
- The same can be done with Tensorflow and Keras to train models which might be slightly accurate.
 ## Requirements:
 - Make sure you have opencv 3.4.4.19 installed
 - To install opencv head on to your terminal and pip install the following:
 --  pip install opencv-python==3.4.4.19
 - That's the only package you need!
 - The cascade files are included in dataXML directory. 
 - After cloning those (.xml) files, just make sure they are in your project directory.\
Happy coding!
