- Used OpenCV to detect hand motion which checks the position of the hand (palm/fist) according to a region of interest.
- Used pyautogui for automating inputs.
# Requirements
- Make sure you have OpenCV 3.4.4.19 installed:
  - pip install opencv-python==3.4.4.19
- Install pyautogui:
  - pip install pyautogui
- This can be done using any one cascade classifier (fist/palm). Both the XML files are uploaded in the dataXML directory.\
Happy coding!
